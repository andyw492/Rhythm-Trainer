# Rhythm-Trainer

The idea behind Rhythm Trainer was to allow the user to practice their rhythm using their keyboard. I imagined a program that gave the user visual cues on when to press the keys at the correct time through falling blocks representing the notes. I also wanted a ball moving back and forth that acted as a metronome, and would play a sound every time the user was supposed to press a key. However, the amount of moving elements on the screen caused the ball and the note blocks to move at decreasing speeds, which pretty much caused the whole program to lose its purpose (the ball and the blocks were supposed to move at a steady tempo to guide the user). Once I have a better understanding of how to make everything run smoothly using more advanced programming knowledge, I might revisit this idea in the future.
